The Author: Dan Fox
-------------------

Dan grew up in an engineering household, no tools were off limits. He was
encouraged to play with 68K Macintosh's, Weller soldering irons, Fluke
multimeters and open-up/dismantle any piece of electronics. *(I have since
learned this while primarily coming from an educational first mindset, it
was also reasoned as: "if I child can break these tools they're not quality
tools").*

The first device Dan learned how to program was a HP-32S after picking up the
manual and overwriting his fathers programs with nonsense.

Since then Dan has gone on to working as a Software Engineer professionally,
primarily in the systems & reliability space. With a particular interest in
monitoring & metrics, loadbalancing and simplistic "old" ideas applied
elegantly to modern problems (the "cloud" is the mainframe and dumb-terminal
pattern re-invented, change my mind).
