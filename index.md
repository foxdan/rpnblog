This is Dan's site which is mostly about HP RPN calculators, but may also
feature rants about: Linux; networking; microcontrollers; electronic fuel
injection / engine control unit software and hardware; and anything else that's
worth writing or ranting about.


### Calculators, really?

Yes totally, ENIAC had a 100kHz clock in 1945. Only 30 years later the HP-35
was a consumer device running at 200kHz that could fit in your pocket and
totally annihilated the slide-rule market. The historical significance of these
devices is immense.


### RPN

While we usually view mathematical problems as being algebraic and RPN is born
out of computing restrictions of the time it is actually a far superior and
more user-friendly calculator interface in comparison to algebraic. [I'll make
and argument for that here](/basic_rpn).
